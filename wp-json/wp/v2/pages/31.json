If you&#8217;re not gaining weight or getting bigger, it&#8217;s not enough. You must eat more. You don&#8217;t need any specific foods to do this &#8211; take what you&#8217;re already eating, and eat more of it.<\/p>\n<p>Keep in mind that bodyweight can fluctuate by up to 5 pounds or more in a day due to food, urine\/feces, water retention, and glycogen, and you should be tracking a trend over at least a month before worrying. Just because the scale went up yesterday and down today does not mean you actually lost weight or your progress. Furthermore, remember that you do not want to be gaining weight <em>too<\/em> rapidly &#8211; muscle is built slowly even in the best conditions, and if you eat too much extra you will just get fat.<\/p>\n<p>If you are\u00a0<strong>absolutely certain<\/strong>\u00a0that you are eating enough to result in weight gain, but you have not over a long period of time, then you should consult with a doctor, as the only alternative is a disease or disorder that\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Fitness\" rel=\"nofollow\">r\/Fitness<\/a> cannot help you with.

He\u2019d go from 198 to 308 and then to 275 and back down to 198. And he was never fat. It was amazing.<\/p>\n<p>I finally asked him one day how he did it.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cYou mean I never told you the secret to gaining weight? Come outside and I\u2019ll fill you in.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Now remember, we\u2019re at Westside Barbell. And this guy wants to go outside to talk so no one else can hear. Think about that for a minute. What the hell is he going to tell me? This must be some serious shit if we have to go outside, I thought.<\/p>\n<p>So we get outside and he starts talking.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cFor breakfast you need to eat four of those breakfast sandwiches from McDonalds. I don\u2019t care which ones you get, but make sure to get four. Order four hash browns, too. Now grab two packs of mayonnaise and put them on the hash browns and then slip them into the sandwiches. Squish that shit down and eat. That\u2019s your breakfast.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>At this point I\u2019m thinking this guy is nuts. But he\u2019s completely serious.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cFor lunch you\u2019re gonna eat Chinese food. Now I don\u2019t want you eating that crappy stuff. You wanna get the stuff with MSG. None of that non-MSG bullshit. I don\u2019t care what you eat but you have to sit down and eat for at least 45 minutes straight. You can\u2019t let go of the fork. Eat until your eyes swell up and&#8230; [REDACTED]\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cFor dinner you\u2019re gonna order an extra-large pizza with everything on it. Literally everything. If you don\u2019t like sardines, don\u2019t put \u2019em on, but anything else that you like you have to load it on there. After you pay the delivery guy, I want you to take the pie to your coffee table, open that fucker up, and grab a bottle of oil. It can be olive oil, canola oil, whatever. Anything but motor oil. And I want you to pour that shit over the pie until half of the bottle is gone. Just soak the shit out of it.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cNow before you lay into it, I want you to sit on your couch and just stare at that fucker. I want you to understand that that pizza right there is keeping you from your goals.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>This guy is in a zen-like state when he\u2019s talking about this.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cNow you\u2019re on the clock,\u201d he continues. \u201cAfter 20 minutes your brain is going to tell you you\u2019re full. Don\u2019t listen to that shit. You have to try and eat as much of the pizza as you can before that 20-minute mark. Double up pieces if you have to. I\u2019m telling you now, you\u2019re going to get three or four pieces in and you\u2019re gonna want to quit. You fucking can\u2019t quit. You have to sit on that couch until every piece is done.<\/p>\n<p>And if you can\u2019t finish it, don\u2019t you ever come back to me and tell me you can\u2019t gain weight. \u2019Cause I\u2019m gonna tell you that you don\u2019t give a fuck about getting bigger and you don\u2019t care how much you lift!\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Did I do it? Hell yeah. Started the next day and did it for two months. Went from 260 pounds to 297 pounds. And I didn\u2019t get much fatter. One of the hardest things I\u2019ve ever done in my life, though.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The important thing to take away from this anecdote is that no matter how much you think you are eating, you are not eating: four McDonald&#8217;s breakfast sandwiches, four orders of hash browns, 45 non-stop minutes worth of a Chinese food buffet, and an extra large pizza with every possible topping that is also drowning in olive oil every single day. And until you are eating that much every day, it does not matter how hard you think you are trying &#8211; you are not trying hard enough to gain weight.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Table of Contents But I&#8217;m a hardgai&#8230;But I have a fast metab&#8230;But it&#8217;s hard to eat so mu&#8230;But I&#8217;m not hungry enough&#8230; If you are not gaining weight, you are not eating enough and are not reaching a calorie surplus.
