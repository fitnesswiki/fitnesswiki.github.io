The primary goal is to be a simple, easy to follow routine that will help beginners get into the gym, start training with the standard barbell lifts, and build a habit of going to the gym consistently. Consistency over time is the biggest point of failure in making progress, and the aim is to lower the barrier as far as possible to starting and staying consistent.<\/p>\n<p>A secondary goal is to start from Day 1 thinking about progress in more than one dimension &#8211; not just increasing weight, but in increasing reps at a certain weight. Focusing entirely on weight increases is a common deficiency in other, similar beginner&#8217;s routines that often ends up causing mindset problems in the long term.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"How_long_should_I_run_this_for\"><\/span>How long should I run this for?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Follow this routine for a maximum of three months. After that point, your long term progress is better served by moving on to a more comprehensive routine that has more training volume and greater variety of movements, rep ranges, and intensity.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s generally recommended to use either <a href=\"https:\/\/thefitness.wiki\/routines\/gzclp\/\">GZCLP<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/thefitness.wiki\/routines\/5-3-1-for-beginners\/\">5\/3\/1 for Beginners<\/a> as a good next step, but just about anything on the <a href=\"https:\/\/thefitness.wiki\/routines\/strength-training-muscle-building\/\">Recommended Routines<\/a> page is perfectly fine too.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Barbell_Strength_Training\"><\/span>Barbell Strength Training<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>The program itself is very straightforward. You alternate between <strong>Workout A<\/strong> and <strong>Workout B<\/strong>, leaving one full day of rest between each day of lifting. This is typically three days a week (ie, Mon \/ Wed \/ Fri) because it&#8217;s easier to schedule, but can also be done A-&gt;Rest-&gt;B-&gt;Rest-&gt;Repeat if your schedule allows.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Workout A<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>3&#215;5+ Barbell Rows<\/li>\n<li>3&#215;5+ Bench Press<\/li>\n<li>3&#215;5+ Squats<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Workout B<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>3&#215;5+ Chinups (or equivalent)<\/li>\n<li>3&#215;5+ Overhead Press<\/li>\n<li>3&#215;5+ Deadlifts<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You do all sets of one lift, then move on to the next.<\/p>\n<p>The notation here is <a href=\"http:\/\/thefitness.wiki\/glossary\/\">Sets x Reps<\/a> &#8211; three sets of five reps. The &#8220;+&#8221; at the end denotes that the last set is AMRAP &#8211; As Many Reps As Possible.<\/p>\n<p>The last set should not be to absolute muscular failure &#8211; try to get a feel for when you have 1-2 reps left in you. A good way to gauge when to stop is when your form breaks down or the speed of the bar slows significantly compared to the previous reps. You want these to be crisp, quality reps. Taking time to learn what real failure feels like and how to find this stopping point is one of the purposes of this routine.<\/p>\n<p>Rest 2-3 minutes between each set, depending on how you feel. You can rest up to 5 minutes between exercises.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Progression\"><\/span>Progression<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Add 2.5 lbs to the upper body lifts (Bench, Overhead Press, Row, Chinup) each day you do the lift.<\/li>\n<li>Add 5 lbs to the lower body lifts (Squat, Deadlift) each day you do the lift.<\/li>\n<li>This weight is added to the\u00a0<strong>total<\/strong> weight of the lift &#8211; not to each side.<\/li>\n<li>If you do more than 10 reps on your AMRAP set, double the weight progression and add 5\/10lbs instead.<\/li>\n<li>If you fail to complete at least 15 total reps for a lift, deload by subtracting 10% from the weight the next time you do that lift. Use this time to set new rep records at past weights.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Cardio_and_Conditioning\"><\/span>Cardio and Conditioning<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>In addition to the barbell strength training, you will also do a minimum of two days a week of cardio and conditioning work.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: var(--color-text);\">One day of lower intensity. Your options are things like brisk walks, jogging, light cycling, elliptical machines, and so on. This should be something you can sustain for 15-30 minutes at a time.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: var(--color-text);\">One day of higher intensity. Your options are things like High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT), Tabata, circuits, or most things you find on our <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/thefitness.wiki\/routines\/cardio-and-conditioning\/\">Cardio and Conditioning<\/a><span style=\"color: var(--color-text);\"> page. This should be something that is relatively hard that you definitely can&#8217;t do for very long. 10-15 minutes is usually plenty if done right.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>This part of the routine is very, very flexible so don&#8217;t overthink your choices here. The specifics of what you do are much less important than that you&#8217;re simply doing the work.<\/p>\n<p>You can do your cardio and conditioning work on any day of the week. If you do it on the same day you are lifting weights, it&#8217;s best to do it <em>after<\/em> the lifting &#8211; otherwise it will likely tire you out some and your performance in the lifting may suffer.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Frequently_Asked_Questions\"><\/span>Frequently Asked Questions<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"How_do_I_find_my_starting_weights_for_each_lift\"><\/span>How do I find my starting weights for each lift?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Start with an empty barbell and do a set of five reps. If this is completed easily with good form, add 10-20 lbs to the bar for the next set. If bar speed does not slow and form does not break down, add another 10-20 lbs to the bar and perform another set. Continue this process adding weight as appropriate until either form falters or the bar speed slows significantly more than the preceding sets, whichever comes first. This is now your starting weight. Rests and perform the rest of your work sets at this weight.\u00a0 Don&#8217;t try to kill it on this initial test, be conservative.\u00a0 The intent here is not to find your max, but to find a good starting point that allows for quality work sets and ample room for improvement.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"What_should_I_do_if_I_cant_do_chinups\"><\/span>What should I do if I can&#8217;t do chinups?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Not to worry &#8211; there are plenty of good options for this situation<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Do negatives<\/li>\n<li>Use a lat pulldown machine<\/li>\n<li>Follow a chinup \/ pullup progression method from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/bodyweightfitness\/wiki\/exercises\/pullup\">r\/bodyweightfitness<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Use resistance bands or an assisted chinup machine<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"How_do_I_add_25_lbs_to_the_upper_body_lifts\"><\/span>How do I add 2.5 lbs to the upper body lifts?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>If your gym doesn&#8217;t have micro plates (1.25 lbs), you have several options:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Buy your own and bring them with you.

Make sure it is secure to prevent injury.<\/li>\n<li>Move up in 5 lb increments instead.
