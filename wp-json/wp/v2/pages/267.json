It&#8217;s take dedicated effort and vigilance to correct the root cause. Also, be willing to accept the fact that some issues just can&#8217;t or won&#8217;t be fixed by a few simple stretches or exercises.<\/p>\n<p>For more information related to posture:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Greg Nuckols recommends this detailed write-up on\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.painscience.com\/articles\/posture.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Posture correction strategies and exercises<\/a>\u00a0(and some reasons not to care or bother).<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/cor-kinetic.com\/science-behind-assessing-blaming-posture-pain-bs\/\">The Science Behind Why Assessing and Blaming Posture for Pain is BS<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/cor-kinetic.com\/is-your-anterior-pelvic-tilt-slowly-killing-you\/\">Is Your Anterior Pelvic Tilt Slowly Killing You?<\/a> (No)<\/li>\n<li>ExRx.com has a good page on\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.exrx.net\/Kinesiology\/Posture.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Common Postural Deficiencies<\/a>\u00a0with suggested corrective exercises.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>For posts, questions, and further advice, check out\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/posture\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">\/r\/posture<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Posture can be both an albatross and a red herring.
