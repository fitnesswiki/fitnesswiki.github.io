[&#8230;] Exercise is physical activity done for its own sake, either during the workout or immediately after it\u2019s through.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>Training is physical activity performed for the purpose of satisfying a long-term performance goal, and is therefore about the process instead of the workouts themselves.<\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>We make this distinction up front because the majority of information in this Wiki is for those who want to\u00a0<em>train<\/em>\u00a0&#8211; who have some physique or performance goal that goes beyond simply being generally physically active or regularly getting in a workout.<\/p>\n<p>If what you want is to exercise or be generally physically active, that&#8217;s great too! It&#8217;s always better to get some physical activity in your life than to be totally sedentary. However, for the most part, the specifics are going to matter very little to you &#8211; you can do pretty much anything on any day and you&#8217;ll meet your goal.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"The_Importance_of_Having_a_Program\"><\/span>The Importance of Having a Program<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Having a solid workout routine to follow, rather than showing up at the gym and winging it, has the following important benefits:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>It provides structure and helps with scheduling.<\/li>\n<li>It makes sure you are getting enough rest and recovery between training sessions.<\/li>\n<li>It saves you time always knowing what to do when you get to the gym.<\/li>\n<li>It gives you a plan for continuing to drive progress over time, so you don&#8217;t stall and stagnate.<\/li>\n<li>It helps you know how hard to work in the gym, so you don&#8217;t work harder than you can handle or too little to make progress.<\/li>\n<li>It ensures you are not neglecting muscles or muscle groups, so you don&#8217;t develop imbalances that can lead to tightness and pain, and don&#8217;t look oddly proportioned.<\/li>\n<li>It removes the need to spend excessive amounts of time doing research for answers to many questions about training.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In addition, it is important that your routine came from someone experienced &#8211; this means that it shouldn&#8217;t be some random dude&#8217;s Biceps 900 routine, and you probably shouldn&#8217;t create one yourself. There is no shame in &#8220;copying the smart kid&#8217;s homework&#8221; &#8211; in fact, it&#8217;s\u00a0<em>exactly what you should do<\/em>. Following a plan that is tried and true (with at most minor tweaks to make it fit your life or equipment access) is always the best option. Training without a program is like building a house without blueprints. Here&#8217;s a good thread to read with some discussion on this subject &#8211;\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Fitness\/comments\/alfpml\/is_this_subreddit_over_focused_on_programming\/\">Is this subreddit over focused on programming?

This type of training is not just for powerlifters and bodybuilders, or people who want to get &#8220;jacked&#8221;. Gaining strength and muscle have numerous health and lifestyle benefits, and you don&#8217;t need to worry about becoming a &#8220;mass monster&#8221; overnight because you start lifting weights. Building that much muscle is\u00a0<em>hard<\/em>. For well rounded fitness pursuits, it&#8217;s a very good idea to do\u00a0<em>some<\/em> strength training even if it&#8217;s not your primary focus. Here are some of the benefits:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Improved ability to manipulate \/ move objects in day-to-day life, including yourself<\/li>\n<li>Increased bone density and reduced risk of osteoporosis<\/li>\n<li>Improved balance and reduced risk of falls<\/li>\n<li>Can reduce symptoms of arthritis, back pain, obesity, heart disease, depression, and diabetes<\/li>\n<li>Can improve cognitive ability in older adults<\/li>\n<li>Can improve blood pressure, triglyceride levels, and HDL<\/li>\n<li>Can reduce risk of cancer<\/li>\n<li>Broadly reduces risk of injury<\/li>\n<li>Can help maintain joint flexibility<\/li>\n<li>Improved ability to control weight gain through increased calorie usage<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Why_You_Should_Do_Cardio\"><\/span>Why You Should Do Cardio<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Like strength training, cardiovascular exercise is an important component of a well rounded fitness pursuit and has numerous health benefits. It has long been a meme that &#8220;cardio kills gains&#8221;, but this is far from the truth, and avoiding cardio can even hold your strength training back. Two excellent articles from Stronger By Science to read on this:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.strongerbyscience.com\/cardio-hypertrophy\/\">Cardio isn&#8217;t going to kill your gains.

The truth is that Many Roads Lead To Rome and routine selection is rarely the make-or-break it&#8217;s made out to be. All of the routines on the <a href=\"https:\/\/thefitness.wiki\/routines\/\">Recommended Routines<\/a> page are effective and reliable, so don&#8217;t sweat your choice and definitely don&#8217;t get hung up on trying to select what&#8217;s &#8220;optimal&#8221;.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Recommended_Starting_Plan\"><\/span>Recommended Starting Plan<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>If you are new to strength training or exercise in general,\u00a0r\/Fitness\u00a0recommends the following path:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Start with\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/thefitness.wiki\/routines\/r-fitness-basic-beginner-routine\/\">the r\/Fitness Basic Beginner Routine<\/a>. This is a straightforward, bare-bones routine to help you get comfortable with fundamental barbell lifts which are a core component of most lifting routines and includes guidelines for cardio and conditioning work.\u00a0 Follow this plan for a maximum of 3 months. If you are already comfortable with the fundamental barbell lifts, you should probably skip this step.<\/li>\n<li>After 3 months, switch your routine to either\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/thefitness.wiki\/routines\/resistance-training\/5-3-1-for-beginners\/\">5\/3\/1 for Beginners<\/a>\u00a0or\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/old.reddit.com\/r\/Fitness\/comments\/44hnbc\/strength_training_using_the_gzcl_method_from\/\">GZCLP<\/a>. If you choose GZCLP, be sure you add a minimum of one day of light cardio and one day of HIIT \/ conditioning. Stick with this for at least 6 months.<\/li>\n<li>After at least 6 months, feel free to start looking at other routines if you&#8217;d like.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>If you don&#8217;t have access to barbells and related equipment<\/strong>, it is strongly recommended that you try to get access to them as soon as possible. Many of the most reliable and effective strength training routines use barbell compound lifts as their bread and butter, and for good reason &#8211; they will give you the best bang for your buck and tend to be the most efficient.
