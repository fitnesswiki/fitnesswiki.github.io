If you have never run 5\/3\/1 before, you will initially set your Training Max as a percentage of your Estimated 1 Rep Max. This is discussed in more detail below.<\/p>\n<p>While there is technically no minimum strength requirement for this program, if your Estimated 1 Rep Maxes for the Squat, Overhead Press, and Bench Press are not at least 75lbs, you may find it <em>logistically<\/em> difficult to follow, because some days will take some of your training sets below 45lbs &#8211; the weight of an unloaded barbell. The best way to adapt to this is to use dumbbell variations of these three lifts.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, if your Estimated 1 Rep Max for the Deadlift is below 230lbs, be sure you have a way to simulate the same bar height as if it were loaded with standard 45lb plates for some days, when some sets will be below 135lbs. This is most commonly done using bumper plates or blocks.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Quick_Program_Overview\"><\/span>Quick Program Overview<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>This section is a barebones overview of the program. This is all covered in greater detail in the sections below.<\/p>\n<p>On each of the three lifting days, you will be doing the following:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Quick warmup of jumping or throwing movements.<\/li>\n<li>Eight sets of your first Main Lift for the day. Your third set is an AMRAP (As Many Reps As Possible) set. Optionally, three more warmup sets can be done first.<\/li>\n<li>Eight sets of your second Main Lift for the day. Your third set is an AMRAP set.<\/li>\n<li>50-100 reps of one Push, one Pull, and one Single Leg or Core exercise.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>The exercises you choose in #4 can be done between sets of either of your Main Lift to save time.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Training_Max_Basics\"><\/span>Training Max Basics<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>The main work for 5\/3\/1 programs is done as percentages of a Training Max (TM). Progression to higher weights is also via the Training Max, which is explained in further detail below.<\/p>\n<p>To set your initial Training Max when starting this program:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>For each of the main lifts (squat, bench press, overhead press, deadlift), work up to a weight that you can only complete 3-5 reps of with good bar speed.<\/li>\n<li>Take this weight and the number of reps and calculate your estimated One Rep Max (1RM) using a calculator such as <a href=\"http:\/\/www.exrx.net\/Calculators\/OneRepMax.html\">this one<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li>Take 90% of the estimated 1RM and use this as your starting Training Max.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Important<\/strong> <\/span><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Note<\/span>: <\/strong>This will be the only time that your TM is so directly connected to your 1RM. A core philosophy of 5\/3\/1 is to train sub-maximally and drive steady progress over time. As you go through the program your strength will be increasing above what your TM is set at, and this is intended. Always remember that the purpose of the Training Max is to inform your workout &#8211; it is not a measure of your progress or your strength. With 5\/3\/1, your workouts are almost never about\u00a0<em>testing<\/em> your strength &#8211; they are about building it.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"General_Pre-Workout_Warm_Up\"><\/span>General Pre-Workout Warm Up<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Before you do any of the lifting, choose one of the following and perform 10-15 total reps over 2-3 sets.

Wouldn&#8217;t faster progression be better?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Trainees who are new to programs like 5\/3\/1 often get concerned about the &#8220;slower progression&#8221; of the Training Max when compared to some other novice programs that have you add weight to the bar every training day (&#8220;Linear Progression&#8221;). This is understandable, but it comes from a fundamental misunderstanding &#8211; that progression of the loading of the barbell in training is the same as the progression of the strength of the lifter. While these two things are definitely connected, they are far from being one-to-one, and submaximal training has been tested by both time and science as an effective method of driving strength and muscle development.<\/p>\n<p>5\/3\/1, like the majority of lifting programs by reputable coaches, is a training methodology that operates in multiple dimensions &#8211; it manages intensity, volume, and fatigue, exposes you to different rep ranges and movements, and measures progress as more than just training weights &#8211; all very important factors for long term success in your training. A traditional LP program does not manage any of these things, and only works in a single dimension &#8211; weight on the bar &#8211; which is not only suboptimal but actively detrimental to your long term training and mindset. You can read some additional related thoughts <a href=\"https:\/\/thefitness.wiki\/faq\/starting-strength-and-stronglifts-not-recommended\/#The_way_they_handle_stalls_is_nonsensical\">here<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/thefitness.wiki\/faq\/starting-strength-and-stronglifts-not-recommended\/#They_neglect_all_aspects_of_strength_development_except_one\">here<\/a>, from the page explaining why Starting Strength and StrongLifts are not recommended.<\/p>\n<p>Most programs like 5\/3\/1 will have moments of testing built in to them for you to use to measure progress over time. If you want to succeed in the long term, you will need to learn to trust the process and use the periodic AMRAP sets and test weeks to check on your progress &#8211; not look to be testing your progress in every set of every training session.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"wiki_regular_training_max_testing_.2F_deloading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Regular_Training_Max_Testing_Deloading\"><\/span>Regular Training Max Testing \/ Deloading<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Though this is not part of the original article, we strongly encourage using the TM Test Week protocol that is <a href=\"https:\/\/thefitness.wiki\/5-3-1-primer\/#Training_Max_Testing_and_Deloading\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">outlined on the 5\/3\/1 Primer page<\/a>.
