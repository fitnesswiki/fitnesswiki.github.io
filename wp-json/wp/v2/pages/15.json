The world is full of\u00a0 people who have yo-yo&#8217;d for years because they went about it that way. Your current\/old habits are what got you where you don&#8217;t want to be. You must build new habits and may need to completely change your relationship with food.<\/p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t let this daunt you. Changing your lifestyle does not have to mean throwing out all the foods you love forever and eating nothing but bland chicken salads every day (unless you want it to).

The first step to changing your weight is understanding the fundamental mechanism of weight change &#8211; calorie balance.<\/p>\n<p>Your body uses an amount of calories every day to fuel itself and activity &#8211; this is called your Total Daily Energy Expenditure or TDEE. The difference between how many calories you eat and your TDEE is what determines whether you gain weight, lose weight, or stay the same weight. Eat less than your TDEE (a deficit), and you will lose weight. Eat more (a surplus), and you will gain weight &#8211; and if you&#8217;re doing strength training, some of it will be muscle. This is often referred to as &#8220;Calories In, Calories Out&#8221; or &#8220;CICO&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>CICO is sometimes confused as being a diet in and of itself, but it&#8217;s not &#8211; it&#8217;s just an underlying\u00a0principle\u00a0that describes the mechanism of weight change. There are factors can make reaching the correct calorie balance easier or harder for different people.\u00a0You may need to try a few different dietary strategies before you find one that&#8217;s easy for you, personally, to stick with. But no matter what dietary strategy you choose, in the end it <em>must<\/em> boil down to changing your calorie balance, even if it&#8217;s by proxy instead of directly (ie, counting calories).<\/p>\n<p>You don&#8217;t necessarily need to dive in to meticulous tracking of calories and food to start &#8211; in fact, sometimes doing so can be overwhelming and therefore detrimental. However, if you&#8217;re having trouble gaining or losing the weight you want over a period of time, at some point you&#8217;re probably going to have to start paying attention to and manipulating your caloric balance.<\/p>\n<p>See also:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/thefitness.wiki\/faq\/why-cant-i-lose-weight\/\">Why can&#8217;t I lose weight?<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/thefitness.wiki\/faq\/why-cant-i-gain-weight\/\">Why can&#8217;t I gain weight?<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/thefitness.wiki\/faq\/what-is-more-important-for-weight-loss-calories-or-macros\/\">What is more important for weight loss &#8211; calories or macros?<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"General_Diet_Improvement\"><\/span><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">General Diet Improvement<\/span><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>If you&#8217;re not looking to get into the weeds with calories and macronutrients, you can often make progress just by making some general improvements to your eating habits. A great place to start is with the Tailor-Made Nutrition article series by John Berardi, PhD:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.t-nation.com\/diet-fat-loss\/tailor-made-nutrition-1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Tailor-Made Nutrition &#8211; Part 1<\/a>\u00a0(Read time: ~15 minutes)<\/p>\n<p>Here are some broad general guidelines on &#8220;cleaning up&#8221; your diet that will serve you well:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Prefer whole foods as much as possible<\/li>\n<li>Eat plenty of vegetables<\/li>\n<li>Avoid snacking between meals if your goal is weight loss<\/li>\n<li>Limit consumption of sugar, sweets, junk food, and alcohol\n<ul>\n<li>You don&#8217;t have to give these up entirely, just be smart about it, and understand the trade offs.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You can also get some &#8220;tough love&#8221; advice from Coach Dan John&#8217;s article <a href=\"https:\/\/www.t-nation.com\/diet-fat-loss\/eat-like-a-warrior-king\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Eat Like a Warrior King<\/a>:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Someone recently asked me about &#8220;the secret to nutrition.&#8221; Seriously, you don&#8217;t know what to do about food? Here&#8217;s an idea: eat like an adult.<\/p>\n<p>Stop eating fast food, stop eating kid&#8217;s cereal, knock it off with all the sweets and comfort foods, and ease up on the snacking. And don&#8217;t act like you don&#8217;t know this: eat more vegetables and fruits.<\/p>\n<p>Really, how difficult is this? Stop with the whining. Stop with the excuses. Act like an adult and stop eating like a television commercial. Grow up.<\/p>\n<p>It reminds me of what they tell students at top universities: &#8220;Look to your right. Now, look to your left. Every person around you was a straight-A student in high school, class president, and valedictorian. Get over it.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Every success in your life doesn&#8217;t call for several extra rounds of beer, a salutary doughnut, and high fives from everyone. You&#8217;re an adult now; you don&#8217;t need a cookie every time you do something special.<\/p>\n<p>Great athletes score a touchdown, goal, or point and just keep moving along. It&#8217;s your job, so get over it. So, if you want to look good in the future, you have to start looking at food like, well, food and not a reward.<\/p>\n<p>Step one to the kingly approach to eating is to have a long-term focus. We all know that vegetables, lean protein, and fresh water are probably the best choices meal-in and meal-out the rest of your life. If you hover around those choices for the bulk of your meals, you&#8217;ll be fine. You know this. Do this.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Calories_and_Calorie_Balance\"><\/span><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Calories and Calorie Balance<\/span><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Quick refresher:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>To\u00a0<strong>lose<\/strong>\u00a0weight, you must eat\u00a0<strong>fewer<\/strong>\u00a0calories than your TDEE &#8211; a\u00a0<strong>deficit<\/strong>.<\/li>\n<li>To\u00a0<strong>gain<\/strong>\u00a0weight, you must eat\u00a0<strong>more<\/strong>\u00a0calories than your TDEE &#8211; a\u00a0<strong>surplus<\/strong>.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>To manage your calorie balance in the way you need for your goals, you will need to know both how many calories are coming in and how many calories are going out. Neither of these are an exact science, and the &#8220;calories out&#8221; part especially so. Remember that any calculation of your TDEE is always going to be just an estimate and is not carved in stone. The scale, however, doesn&#8217;t lie about your calorie balance.<\/p>\n<p>For tracking your &#8220;calories in&#8221;, tools such as\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.myfitnesspal.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">MyFitnessPal<\/a>\u00a0or\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/nutritiondata.self.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">NutritionData<\/a> are very useful. They keep large databases of calorie and macronutrient information at various serving sizes. Google can also be a very powerful tool for finding this information. If you&#8217;re\u00a0<em>really<\/em> having trouble, you may also need to individually weigh your food with a food scale to be sure you have an accurate serving size.<\/p>\n<p>For estimating your &#8220;calories out&#8221;, any TDEE calculator you can find on the internet will offer you a good initial target to shoot for. <strong>Remember that this is <em>an imprecise estimate only<\/em> and your actual TDEE may be higher or lower.<\/strong> Don&#8217;t get caught up in trying to find the perfect starting number. Expect it to be inaccurate at first and expect to have to adjust it. For the longer term, r\/Fitness users have got a lot of value out of the <a href=\"https:\/\/drive.google.com\/open?id=0B8EbfzFB0mBrMGJ6V2N5QWNfeTg\" rel=\"nofollow\">3-Suns Adaptive TDEE Spreadsheet<\/a>. It will give you an estimate as a starting point, and as you enter your weight and calories consumed each day, it will calibrate and give you a more accurate picture of your TDEE over time.<\/p>\n<p>The most common recommendation is to add or subtract 10-20% of your TDEE to determine your daily calorie needs. While it&#8217;s attractive to get results &#8220;faster&#8221; by doing crash diets or &#8220;dirty bulking&#8221;, being relatively conservative is important for health, adherence, and satisfaction in the long term.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>When gaining weight, the higher above your TDEE you go, the more fat you will gain along with building muscle. It will also be more difficult to make large jumps in food intake without discomfort.<\/li>\n<li>When losing weight, the lower below your TDEE you go, the harder it will be to preserve muscle and maintain athletic performance. You&#8217;ll also be at greater risk for nutritional deficiencies and rebounding through binge eating.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Keep in mind also that your weight is a factor in your TDEE, so as your weight goes up or down, so too will your TDEE, and you will need to periodically re-evaluate your estimate. Keeping track of your weight over a period of time is a good way to do this. If your weight remains unchanged for a few weeks or more, it&#8217;s probably time to make an adjustment.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Macronutrients\"><\/span><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Macronutrients<\/span><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>These are protein, fat, and carbohydrates &#8211; as opposed to\u00a0<em>micro<\/em>nutrients, which are vitamins and minerals.<\/p>\n<p>Macronutrients (or simply &#8220;macros&#8221;) are often an area of contentious debate that are rarely as important as they are sometimes treated.

Recommendations by Eric Helms, PhD go up to 0.8-1g\/lb for building muscle, and up to 1.3g\/lb while dieting to preserve muscle. For most purposes, 120g-160g per day is a very good place to start, with room to add more if you want. The maximum that research has shown to be beneficial for muscle <em>growth<\/em> is 0.82g\/lb, but there&#8217;s no danger or waste in going above that (<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Protein_poisoning\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">as long as you don&#8217;t eat\u00a0<em>only<\/em> protein).<\/a><\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to read some more detailed articles about protein and research on it, below are some excellent ones.
